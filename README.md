## Laravel Monolith Boilerplate

I have started this repo as a learning exercise. Over the last year or so I have been delving back into learning more as
I felt I was getting stagnant and not progressing with my ability to produce better code.

The bolierplate consists of:

- My preferred stack currently is VILT - so that's what I have stuck with here (Vue3, InertiaJS, Laravel, Tailwind)
- Jetstream as I use it in most projects
  - Updated Vue components to typescript
  - Updated backend code to use DTO's where I could
  - All tests still passing
- A domain driven like structure for backend code - including moving jetstream code.

All the resources above helped shaped this boilerplate into something I can now grab and start building my applications and projects without 
the need to worry about structure and setup. I recommend grabbing each of the resources and studying them, they're each individually great in their own rights.

If there's any questions or improvements that can be made, please feel free to open an issue or submit a PR. 
I will be actively updating this repo when new versions of the packages used are released!
